This code is currently private, and only contributors of the djgroen/flee GitHub repository, as well as those specifically authorized by the owner (Derek Groen), are allowed to use or modify it.

The primary reason for this is that the code is relatively simple, and other researchers could use it to perform the research we 
are doing on a faster timescale if they have more people available.

In the near future, when the code has matured and when we've written a few fundamental papers, we will however release the code to the wider public.
When we do so, we will distribute it under a permissive BSD 3-clause license.
