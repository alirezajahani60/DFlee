Simulation instance construction
================================

This documentation details how to construct a conflict scenario for forced displacement simulation. Each conflict situation requires:

- Three input CSV files:

  - input_csv/locations.csv
  - input_csv/routes.csv
  - input_csv/closures.csv
   
- Validation data files:

  - source_data/refugees.csv
  - source_data/data_layout.csv
  - source_data/<country_name-camp_name1>.csv
  - source_data/<country_name-camp_name2>.csv


Extract forced displacement data from the following databases to create input and validation files: 

- the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees database (UNHCR, https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations).
- the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED, https://www.acleddata.com/data).


Extracting input data 
---------------------

1. The UNHCR situations provides an overview of active situations worldwide that are facing forced displacement distress. To construct a new conflict situation:
  - Select an active (conflict) situation of interest from an interactive map and click to access data and documentation      
    relevant to a chosen conflict situation from https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations.
  - Select a simulation period for conflict situation from ``Refugees and asylum-seekers from `chosen situation name` -       
    Total`` timeline, which also presents forced displacement counts for a chosen period.
  - Obtain total counts of forcibly displaced people by clicking JSON button of ``Refugees and asylum-seekers from `chosen       
    situation name` - Total`` section. 
  - Identify camps for each neighbouring country through ``Breakdown by Country`` section of the conflict situation.
  - Collect and save data for each camp (e.g. <country_name-camp_name>.csv).
  
2. The ACLED database provides conflict location data for forced displacement simulations. To obtain data on chosen conflict situation, complete the ACLED data export tool fields (https://www.acleddata.com/data) as follows:
  - Provide dates of interest for conflict situation (i.e. From and To).
  - Select ``Event Type: Battle``.
  - Select ``Sub Event Type``
  
    - Armed clash, 
    - Attack, 
    - Government regains territory and 
    - Non-state actor overtakes territory.
    
  - Specify ``Region`` and ``Country`` of conflict situation choice.
  - Accept ``Terms of Use and Attribution Policy``.
  - <name>.csv file exports to Downloads automatically.
  - Revise the downloaded <name>.csv file:
  
    - Target the ``fatalities`` column and remove all rows in <name>.csv file with fatalities less than 1.
    - Choose the first conflict location occurrences of each location but exclude syndicated (repeated) locations.

An example of conflict locations (A, B and C). Conflict zone A occurs two times with fatality numbers 3 and 38, while conflict zone C repeats twice with fatalities 14 and 7. Choose essence of locations (one of each location) at the first occurrence (e.g. A = 3, B = 23 and C = 14) for simulation purposes.
       
=====   ==========   ============  
...     Location     Fatalities
-----   ----------   ------------
...         A             3
...         B             23
...         A             38
...         C             14
...         C             7
...        ...            ...

Constructing input CSV files
----------------------------

1. Construct an input **locations.csv** file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ACLED conflict data provides conflict locations to construct **locations.csv** input file for simulation purposes. After identifying conflict locations and producing **locations.csv**, the last column is filled with population data for conflict locations. Population distributions can be obtained from https://www.citypopulation.de or other population databases.

=====  =======  ========  ====  =====  ==============  ==============  ====================
name   region   country   lat   long   location_type   conflict_date   population/capacity 
-----  -------  --------  ----  -----  --------------  --------------  --------------------
 A       AA       ABC     xxx    xxx      conflict          xxx                xxx        
 B       BB       ABC     xxx    xxx      conflict          xxx                xxx          
 C       CC       ABC     xxx    xxx      conflict          xxx                xxx              
...      ...      ...     ...    ...         ...            ...                ...          
=====  =======  ========  ====  =====  ==============  ==============  ====================

Input camp names (i.e. destination locations) and their capacity into **locations.csv** file. Camp capacity is the highest number of forced migrants for each camp and obtained from individual camp CSV files that are set in **locations.csv**. For instance, CampZ.csv has the highest number of forcibly displaced people (18129) on 2015-09-30, which is the camp capacity for CampZ.

===========  =======
...          ...
-----------  -------
2015-03-31   11470
2015-06-02   12405
2015-07-24   12405
2015-08-31   11359
2015-09-30   18129
...          ...
===========  =======



2. Construct an input **routes.csv** file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Identified conflict zones and camps provide origin and destination locations. We connect these locations to represent how forcibly displaced people flee. We use http://www.bing.com/maps (or other mapping services) to connect conflict zones and camps, and add additional locations (if required) as a location type **town** to locations.csv as illustrated below:

=====  =======  ========  ====  =====  ==============  ==============  ====================
name   region   country   lat   long   location_type   conflict_date   population/capacity 
-----  -------  --------  ----  -----  --------------  --------------  --------------------
 A       AA       ABC     xxx    xxx      conflict          xxx                xxx        
 B       BB       ABC     xxx    xxx      conflict          xxx                xxx          
 C       CC       ABC     xxx    xxx      conflict          xxx                xxx          
 Z       ZZ       ZZZ     xxx    xxx        camp                               xxx         
 N       NN       ABC     xxx    xxx        town                                         
...      ...      ...     ...    ...         ...            ...                ...          
=====  =======  ========  ====  =====  ==============  ==============  ====================


Record distances between locations in **routes.csv** file for simulation using the following format:

======  ======  ==============  ===================
name1   name2   distance [km]   forced_redirection  
------  ------  --------------  -------------------
  A       B           x1                            
  B       C           x2                            
  A       C           x3                           
  B       N           x4       
  C       N           x3      
  N       Z           x5    
 ...     ...         ...    
======  ======  ==============  ====================

   .. note: **forced_redirection** refers to redirection from source location (can be town or camp) to destination location     
            (mainly camp) and source location indicated as forwarding_hub. The value of 0 indicates no redirection, 1  
            indicates redirection (from name2) to name1and 2 corresponds to redirection (from name1) to name2.


3. Define location and border closures in **closures.csv** file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We identify location or border closure events and document them in **closures.csv** file:

=============  ======  ======  ==================  =================
closure_type   name1   name2   closure_start = 0   closure_end = -1  
-------------  ------  ------  ------------------  -----------------
   location      A       B            xxx	                xxx        
   country      ABC     ZZZ           xxx	                xxx      
     ...        ...     ...           ...                 ...
=============  ======  ======  ==================  =================
      
**closure_type** has 2 possible values: 

- **location** corresponding to camp or town closure and 
- **country** referring to border closure. 

**closure_start** and **closure_end** are given as integers, counting the number of days after the simulation start. The value of 0 indicates the start, while -1 indicates the end of the simulation.


4. Construct a network map for a conflict situation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Construct an agent-based network map from **locations.csv** and **routes.csv** using https://carto.com.

Constructing validation data
----------------------------

There are three CSV file formats required for validation of simulation outputs. CSV file containing total forced migrant counts **refugees.csv** comprises total counts of forcibly displaced people from ``Refugees and asylum-seekers from `chosen situation name` - Total`` JSON file and has the format as demonstrated:

===========  ====
    ...      ...  
-----------  ---- 
YYYY-MM-DD   xxx  
YYYY-MM-DD   xxx  
    ...      ...  
===========  ====


We obtain data for each camp using the format and label them as **country_name-camp_name.csv**:

===========  ====
    ...      ...  
-----------  ---- 
YYYY-MM-DD   xxx  
YYYY-MM-DD   xxx  
    ...      ...  
===========  ====


**data_layout.csv** contains camp names for each camp/destination locations:

===========  ============================
Total        forced_migrants.csv          
-----------  ---------------------------- 
camp_name1   country_name-camp_name1.csv  
camp_name2   country_name-camp_name2.csv  
...                     ...              
===========  ============================


Constructing a conflict directory
---------------------------------

1. Create <country_name> conflict directory in **~/flee** directory.

2. Create **input_csv** sub-directory to store input CSV files.

3. Create the second sub-directory **source_data** and place inside validation data files.

4. Create <country_name>.py file for a conflict situation. To demonstrate, 
https://github.com/djgroen/flee-release/blob/master/test_csv.py is an example script,
which you can copy and modify according to your choice of conflict scenario.

- Change date in <country_name>.py to the start of conflict simulation date:

  .. code-block:: python
   
                   def date_to_sim_days(date):
                     return DataTable.subtract_dates(date,"2010-01-01")
                     ...
                     d = handle_refugee_data.RefugeeTable(csvformat="generic", ... start_date="2010-01-01", ...)

- Declare input and validation data locations in <country_name>.py file:

  .. code-block:: python

                     ig.ReadLocationsFromCSV("test_data/test_input_csv/locations.csv")

                     ig.ReadLinksFromCSV("test_data/test_input_csv/routes.csv")

                     ig.ReadClosuresFromCSV("test_data/test_input_csv/closures.csv")

                     ...

                    d = handle_refugee_data.RefugeeTable(csvformat="generic", data_directory="test_data/test_input_csv/refugee_data", ...)
