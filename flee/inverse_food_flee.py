# inverse_food_flee.py

# Modified version of food flee implementation by Chris Vassiliou. This version implements my inverted movechance
# hypothesis: "The higher the food insecurity, then refugees are less likely to move elsewhere" this hypothesis
# adjusts the movechance for each location in the simulation based on the food security of that location. it does
# this in a new way, using a new formula i developed.

# variables, critict and IPC_all. critict is the 'day' column of the matrix, and is used to tell the simulation when
# to update the IPC values. IPC_all stores all of the columns that hold IPC data. each column represents a region of
# S Sudan. These variables are made using pandas, an external python library.
